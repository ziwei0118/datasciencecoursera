run the code named "run_analysis" and you will get a file named "output.txt", which is the final tidy data in step 5.

The original dataset is obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This code can achieving the following functions:

1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
